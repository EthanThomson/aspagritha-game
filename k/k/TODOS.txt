grid system:
description: choose between 2d or 3d both of which have problems

different units can take up 1 or more grid squares


GIGABRAIN IDEA: instead of storing the units oj the grid the grid is solely used to as a pointermap to lookup units when maths happens on the grid



fuck server meshing we using GPUs for this my homey 

use opencl for the maths sid of thr game



the movement grid system can work by simply doing the matrix tranformation equation passed to to gpu using opencl
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19985690/how-do-i-implement-a-2d-transformation-matrix 
do this for every unit in parrellel each movement phase of the rising clock reset





I may need server meshing for this
Server meshing:
assign each server instance its own grid area
then one or more servers run the replication layer
grid areas can be assigned dynamically based off units in the area

fuck server meshing im doing gpu programming for this shit
opencl for now


Graphics:
all graphics will be handled though a very advanced system of fonts
this is the fastest version of 2d graphics i can currently think of

group intelligence:
each unit running itself would be a computational nightmare
instead some kind of group intelligence is needed

multi threading:
description: due to upwards of 100 septillion units in use at a single battle this game will need to a
crazy polling system and as that number is well over the unsigned 64 bit int limit
a custom data type will be needed
research:
128 bit would work for the address datatype
96 bytes
2^88

tech & research:
status effects:
armour:
shredded, mangled, destroyed, circuitry issue, coated(fallout, flammables, ), stranglet disintegration, disintegration

self(Human body):
bleed, radiated, detached neural port, oxygen deprived

omni(both armour and self):
fire(staged effect; minimal temp, low temp, med temp, high temp, inferno, conflagration), eradicated
