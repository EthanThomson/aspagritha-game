grid system:
description: choose between 2d or 3d both of which have problems

different units can take up 1 or more grid squares


multi threading:
description: due to upwards of 100 septillion units in use at a single battle this game will need to a
crazy polling system and as that number is well over the unsigned 64 bit int limit
a custom data type will be needed
research:
128 bit would work for the address datatype



unit needs:
[gridpos position, Unit id, int faction, etc...]

tech & research:


status effects:
armour:
shredded, mangled, destroyed, circuitry issue, coated(fallout, ), 

self(Human body):
bleed, eradiated, detached neural port, 

omni(both armour and self):
fire(staged effect; minimal temp, low temp, med temp, high temp, inferno, conflagration)
